	<h4>IMPORTANT-READ CAREFULLY:</h4>

	<p class="important">Read this Terms of Service (&ldquo;<u>Agreement</u>&rdquo;) carefully and be sure you understand it before proceeding.  There are important sections that may limit your rights under applicable law and create obligations upon you if you enter into this Agreement, so review it fully.  This Agreement creates a legally-binding electronic agreement between Kingdomcare, LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability company, and you.  You may accept or reject the terms of this Agreement, upon the following conditions:</strong></p>

	<ol class="upper-alpha parens important">
		<li><p>IF YOU REFUSE OR REJECT ANY OF THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO ACCESS OR USE THE KINGDOMCARE SERVICES, AND YOU MUST NOT PROCEED.  IF YOU CONTINUE TO ACCESS AND USE THE KINGDOMCARE SERVICES, THEN YOU SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED THIS AGREEMENT AND SHALL BE BOUND BY IT.</p></li>

		<li><p>IF YOU ACCEPT, OR ARE DEEMED TO HAVE ACCEPTED, THIS AGREEMENT BY YOUR CONTINUED USE AND ACCESS TO THE KINGDOMCARE SERVICES, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY AND CAPACITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.  FURTHER YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ IT COMPLETELY, UNDERSTAND IT, ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT, AND VOLUNTARILY AGREE TO BE BOUND FULLY BY IT.</p></li>
	</ol>

	<h4>KINGDOMCARE SERVICES</h4>

	<ol class="upper-alpha">
		<li><p>Kingdomcare provides a venue and platform for communication between individuals that are: (a) parents or guardians seeking child-sitting and/or nanny services for minors (&ldquo;<u>Parents</u>&rdquo;), and (b) individuals that wish to offer and provide such child-sitting and/or nanny services (&ldquo;<u>Providers</u>&rdquo;).  For example, Kingdomcare allows you (&ldquo;<u>User</u>&rdquo;), as one of those individuals, to do things such as creating a profile and login, offering child-sitting and nanny services, soliciting child-sitting and nanny services, exchanging communications with other Users about these matters, providing reviews and posts, and other related interactions.  Kingdomcare provides these services via its website(s), application(s), and/or other technology and services that it may choose to offer from time to time (collectively the &ldquo;<u>Kingdomcare Services</u>&rdquo;).</p></li>  

		<li><p>Kingdomcare recognizes the emphasis and importance that parents and guardians might place on the moral and faith-based beliefs of a child-sitter or nanny, entrusted with the responsibility of caring for a loved one.  Therefore, Kingdomcare encourages and requests some information related to these personal beliefs so that Parents and Providers may make decisions that they deem in the best interest of themselves and their children.  However, nothing related to the Kingdomcare Services is intended to discriminate, and Kingdomcare does not limit or restrict access to Kingdomcare Services in any way based on religion, faith, or any other factors legally protected by applicable law.</p></li>  

		<li><p>Kingdomcare is not an employment or temporary employee agency, nor does it employ child-sitters or nannies, and it does not provide referrals or placement services.  It merely provides a venue for communication between Parents and Providers, who are free to enter into employment or service arrangements for child-sitting and nanny services.</p></li>

		<li><p>Kingdomcare is not responsible for screening, verifying, or checking of the experience, skills, employability, representations, statements, qualifications, backgrounds, profiles, locations, or identities of Providers or Parents.  Kingdomcare cannot and does not warrant the accuracy or completeness of information provided or posted by Users.  It is User&rsquo;s responsibility to conduct its own screening, verification, and/or checking of any Users with whom he/she choose to communicate, meet, or otherwise interact through or as a result of Kingdomcare Services.</p></li>

		<li><p>By accessing or utilizing the Kingdomcare Services, inclusive of any associated websites, applications, technologies, or other services offered by Kingdomcare, User agrees to be bound by these Terms of Use (the &ldquo;<u>Agreement</u>&rdquo;).  If you do not accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, you may not access or utilize the Kingdomcare Services, this Kingdomcare website or any of its associated websites, applications, or services.</p></li>
	</ol>

	<h4>ACCESS AND UTILIZATION OF KINGDOMCARE SERVICES</h4>

	<ol class="upper-alpha">
		<li><p>In order to access and utilize the Kingdomcare Services, you will be required to register and create an account (&ldquo;<u>User Account</u>&rdquo;) with a unique login and password.</p></li>  

		<li><p>To create a User Account, you will also be required to provide to Kingdomcare certain information about yourself (&ldquo;<u>User Information</u>&rdquo;).  You will be required to create a profile (&ldquo;<u>User Profile</u>&rdquo;) with information about you that will help facilitate interaction with other Users related to the child-sitting and nanny services.  Because other registered Users may view it, your User Profile should not contain any personal on confidential information, nor any identifying information, telephone numbers, email addresses, home addresses, or other such personal information since it may be viewed by other Users.</p></li>

		<li><p>Your active User Account will allow you to communicate directly with other Users (and other Users to communicate with you) (&ldquo;<u>User Communications</u>&rdquo;) on the subjects of child-sitting and nanny services through the Kingdomcare Services without revealing your private contact information unless and until you elect to do so.  It will also allow you to search User Profiles and to have your User Profile searched by other Users, and will allow you and other Users to make public posts, such as threads and message boards, and post review on the same subject matter.</p></li>    

		<li><p>You agree and consent to receive such User Communications.</p></li>  

		<li><p>You also agree and consent to receive communications, including but not limited to emails, application notices, and text messages, from Kingdomcare.  These communications may be transactional or relationship communications relating to the Kingdomcare Services, such as administrative notices and service announcements or changes, or communications containing commercial offers, promotions or special offers from us or third-party partners.</p></li>
	</ol>

	<h4>USER SUBSCRIPTIONS</h4>

	<ol class="upper-alpha">
		<li><p>As will be communicated in greater detail through the Kingdomcare Services from time to time, Users may select fee-based services, such as Kingdomcare subscriptions, memberships, or passes (collectively &ldquo;<u>Subscriptions</u>&rdquo;), which are detailed on the Kingdomcare website and/or application, and which may be changed or terminated by Kingdomcare from time to time without notice.</p></li>

		<li><p>If selected, you agree to pay Kingdomcare for such fee-based Subscriptions, and authorize Kingdomcare to charge your chosen payment method.  Kingdomcare reserves the right to correct errors or mistakes in such billing as needed.  All such fees are nonrefundable and nontransferable, regardless of any later changes to the Subscriptions offered by Kingdomcare (except to the extent arising from an error by Kingdomcare, to be determined in Kingdomcare&rsquo;s sole discretion).</p></li>

		<li><p>Passes will generally allow limited time or frequency of use, otherwise Subscriptions will continue and auto-renew until cancelled by the User.  At the end of each such Subscription period, the Subscription will automatically renew and be billed for the same Subscription period at the then-current Subscription rate, unless you cancel your Subscription prior to renewal.  For any automatic renewal, you authorize Kingdomcare to charge your chosen payment method the then-current applicable fee.</p></li>

		<li><p>If you purchase a Subscription, use Kingdomcare&rsquo;s Online Payment Service, or otherwise use any fee-based Kingdomcare Services, you agree to Kingdomcare storing your chosen payment information.  You are responsible for maintaining current and accurate payment information. Kingdomcare may terminate a User&rsquo;s Subscription and/or User Account if the User&rsquo;s payment information is expired or is otherwise invalid.</p></li>

		<li><p>To cancel your Subscription, you should complete the cancellation form available here, and thereafter the cancellation will be effective at the end of your then current Subscription term. If you cancel your Subscription, you will continue to have access to your services associated with your Subscription until the cancellation becomes effective. All fees and charges are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits if you cancel your Subscription and/or User Account. All services cease when your Subscription cancellation becomes effective and your Subscription will not renew thereafter. Upon the effective cancellation of your Subscription, you will no longer have access to such services. Cancelling your Subscription will not delete your User Account. You can delete or deactivate your User Account on your My Account page.</p></li>
	</ol>

	<h4>ONLINE PAYMENT SERVICE</h4>

	<p>To help facilitate a Parent&rsquo;s payment to a Provider for Services, Kingdomcare may offer an online payment service. The online payment service may be subject to availability based on geographic area, Subscription enrollment or other bases, as determined by Kingdomcare from time to time hereunder. If available, Providers must accept payments through the online payment service and Parents booking with Providers may choose to make payments online to Providers. Additional information will be available here.</p>
